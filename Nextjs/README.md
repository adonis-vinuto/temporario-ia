## Theme Toggle Feature
The application supports both light and dark themes. Users can toggle between themes using the theme toggle button.

### How to Use the Theme Toggle

The theme toggle button can be added to any component by importing and using the `ThemeToggle` component:

```tsx
import { ThemeToggle } from "@/components/ui/theme-toggle"

export function YourComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemeToggle />
      {/* Your other component content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Theme Provider

The application uses a theme provider that manages the theme state. The theme provider is already set up in the root layout.

You can access the theme state in any component using the `useTheme` hook:

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "@/components/providers/theme-provider"

export function YourComponent() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme("light")}>Light</button>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme("dark")}>Dark</button>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme("system")}>System</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
